# Travelling Salesman Problem using Branch and Bound Approach (Parallel Programming)

Travelling Salesman problem is categorized as a NP-hard problem and can be defined as a path in a directed/undirected graph G such that the path traversed includes every node exactly once wth minimum cost. The most direct solution is to try all the permutations which could lead to a computational complexity to be O(n!) or O(2^n). One such brute force approach implemented using parallel progamming is the Branch and Bound approach.
